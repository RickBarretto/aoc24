# Rick's AOC 2024

This repository is a set of solutions for the AOC24.

Data inputs are missing publicly due to legal issues,
personal input files and samples seems to be copyrighted, 
so I won't provide it here, and you need to download it manually.

Remembering that input files are different for each user,
so if you wan't to try yours, update the code.
